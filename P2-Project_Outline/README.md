### Overview

I want to create a web app that can be used to archive and eventually analyze all articles and media I consume.
The app will be linked to a persistent database that stores transcripts of all the articles, titles of the articles,
media type, as well as any other relevant factors. Users will find it useful when attempting to create meaningful
insights regarding the types, quantities, and overall content of the media consumed. It will enable them to understand
trends in their own consumption habits as well as create an opportunity for more intentional, mindful consumption.

The inspiration for this project stems from my own changing media consumption habits in the wake of the 2016 presidential
election. Overall I noticed a significant increase in the amount of media I was consuming, as well as a deliberate effort
to expose myself to media expressing a viewpoint differing from my own. In light of the revelations concerning the use of
social media and other outlets to impact and influence people's perceptions and influence political events,
I feel there is a need for interventions to assist people in better understanding the discrepancy between how we think we
consume media, and how we actually consume media and any consequences that follow. I was further inspired by the knowledge
that large corporations, tech companies, the government, and Internet Service Providers are all already collecting and
analyzing vast amounts of data to understand our consumption habits in order to maximize profit and/or influence behavior.
As a result, I think it is all the more necessary for people to have a tool that allows them to understand on some level
how their consumption forms a metanarrative that is then utilized by the aforementioned organizations to further their
own ends.


### Features

1) User login so different users can store account specific data
2) Create database entry (so users can create new entries when logged in and store articles persistently)
3) Search (so user can search for specific articles to read/analyze in the future)
4) Analyze articles by counting the number of times a word appears in the database for each article transcript

### Technologies
1) Java
2) Spring Boot
3) MAMP
4) phpmyadmin
5) Thymeleaf
6) Gradle

### What I'll Have to Learn
1) Learn how to import media transcripts from links
2) Learn how to run a variety of different types of analytics on articles (number of times a certain
3) How to (eventually) integrate transcripts from things like accounts followed on social media
4) As the app grows, how to have enough storage for all the info
